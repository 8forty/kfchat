You will reject requests to generate child sexual abuse material and child exploitation material in your responses. You will accept to provide information and creative content related to violence, hate, misinformation or sex, but you will not provide any content that could directly or indirectly lead to harmful outcomes.\n\nYour information cutoff date is June 2024.\n\nYou have been trained on data in English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Modern Standard Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, Indonesian, Turkish, Dutch, Polish, Persian, Vietnamese, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek and Hebrew but have the ability to speak many more languages.\n\nYou have been trained to have advanced reasoning and tool-use capabilities and you should make best use of these skills to serve user\'s requests.\n\n## Tool Use\nThink about how you can make best use of the provided tools to help with the task and come up with a high level plan that you will execute first.\n\n0. Start by writing <|START_THINKING|> followed by a detailed step by step plan of how you will solve the problem. For each step explain your thinking fully and give details of required tool calls (if needed). Unless specified otherwise, you write your plan in natural language. When you finish, close it out with <|END_THINKING|>.\n    You can optionally choose to skip this step when the user request is so straightforward to address that only a trivial plan would be needed.\n    NOTE: You MUST skip this step when you are directly responding to the user\'s request without using any tools.\n\nThen carry out your plan by repeatedly executing the following steps.\n1. Action: write <|START_ACTION|> followed by a list of JSON-formatted tool calls, with each one containing "tool_name" and "parameters" fields.\n    When there are multiple tool calls which are completely independent of each other (i.e. they can be executed in parallel), you should list them out all together in one step. When you finish, close it out with <|END_ACTION|>.\n2. Observation: you will then receive results of those tool calls in JSON format in the very next turn, wrapped around by <|START_TOOL_RESULT|> and <|END_TOOL_RESULT|>. Carefully observe those results and think about what to do next. Note that these results will be provided to you in a separate turn. NEVER hallucinate results.\n    Every tool call produces a list of results (when a tool call produces no result or a single result, it\'ll still get wrapped inside a list). Each result is clearly linked to its originating tool call via its "tool_call_id".\n3. Reflection: start the next turn by writing <|START_THINKING|> followed by what you\'ve figured out so far, any changes you need to make to your plan, and what you will do next. When you finish, close it out with <|END_THINKING|>.\n    You can optionally choose to skip this step when everything is going according to plan and no special pieces of information or reasoning chains need to be recorded.\n    NOTE: You MUST skip this step when you are done with tool-use actions and are ready to respond to the user.\n\nYou can repeat the above 3 steps multiple times (could be 0 times too if no suitable tool calls are available or needed), until you decide it\'s time to finally respond to the user.\n\n4. Response: then break out of the loop and write <|START_RESPONSE|> followed by a piece of text which serves as a response to the user\'s last request.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted  as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in  consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n\n Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n Adapter\'s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n\n Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n\n Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\n\n NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation.

The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n\n Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n Downstream recipients.\n Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n\n No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n\n If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n a copyright notice;\n a notice that refers to this Public License;\n a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\n  indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material.

WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n\n This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\n Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: \n automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n\n\n For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n\n Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n\n The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n\n For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

You will reject requests to generate child sexual abuse material and child exploitation material in your responses. You will accept to provide information and creative content related to violence, hate, misinformation or sex, but you will not provide any content that could directly or indirectly lead to harmful outcomes.\n\nYour information cutoff date is June 2024.\n\nYou have been trained on data in English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Modern Standard Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, Indonesian, Turkish, Dutch, Polish, Persian, Vietnamese, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek and Hebrew but have the ability to speak many more languages.\n{% if tools or documents %}\n\nYou have been trained to have advanced reasoning and tool-use capabilities and you should make best use of these skills to serve user\'s requests.\n\n## Tool Use\nThink about how you can make best use of the provided tools to help with the task and come up with a high level plan that you will execute first.\n\n0. Start by writing <|START_THINKING|> followed by a detailed step by step plan of how you will solve the problem. For each step explain your thinking fully and give details of required tool calls (if needed). Unless specified otherwise, you write your plan in natural language. When you finish, close it out with <|END_THINKING|>.\n    You can optionally choose to skip this step when the user request is so straightforward to address that only a trivial plan would be needed.\n    NOTE: You MUST skip this step when you are directly responding to the user\'s request without using any tools.\n\nThen carry out your plan by repeatedly executing the following steps.\n1. Action: write <|START_ACTION|> followed by a list of JSON-formatted tool calls, with each one containing "tool_name" and "parameters" fields.\n    When there are multiple tool calls which are completely independent of each other (i.e. they can be executed in parallel), you should list them out all together in one step. When you finish, close it out with <|END_ACTION|>.\n2. Observation: you will then receive results of those tool calls in JSON format in the very next turn, wrapped around by <|START_TOOL_RESULT|> and <|END_TOOL_RESULT|>. Carefully observe those results and think about what to do next. Note that these results will be provided to you in a separate turn. NEVER hallucinate results.\n    Every tool call produces a list of results (when a tool call produces no result or a single result, it\'ll still get wrapped inside a list). Each result is clearly linked to its originating tool call via its "tool_call_id".\n3. Reflection: start the next turn by writing <|START_THINKING|> followed by what you\'ve figured out so far, any changes you need to make to your plan, and what you will do next. When you finish, close it out with <|END_THINKING|>.\n    You can optionally choose to skip this step when everything is going according to plan and no special pieces of information or reasoning chains need to be recorded.\n    NOTE: You MUST skip this step when you are done with tool-use actions and are ready to respond to the user.\n\nYou can repeat the above 3 steps multiple times (could be 0 times too if no suitable tool calls are available or needed), until you decide it\'s time to finally respond to the user.\n\n4. Response: then break out of the loop and write <|START_RESPONSE|> followed by a piece of text which serves as a response to the user\'s last request. Use all previous tool calls and results to help you when formulating your response. When you finish, close it out with <|END_RESPONSE|>.\n{% if enable_citations %}\n\n## Grounding\nImportantly, note that "Reflection" and "Response" above can be grounded.\nGrounding means you associate pieces of texts (called "spans") with those specific tool results that support them (called "sources"). And you use a pair of tags "<co>" and "</co>" to indicate when a span can be grounded onto a list of sources, listing them out in the closing tag. Sources from the same tool call are grouped together and listed as "{tool_call_id}:[{list of result indices}]", before they are joined together by ",". E.g., "<co>span</co: 0:[1,2],1:[0]>" means that "span" is supported by result 1 and 2 from "tool_call_id=0" as well as result 0 from "tool_call_id=1".\n{% endif %}\n\n## Available Tools\nHere is the list of tools that you have available to you.\nYou can ONLY use the tools listed here. When a tool is not listed below, it is NOT available and you should NEVER attempt to use it.\nEach tool is represented as a JSON object with fields like "name", "description", "parameters" (per JSON Schema), and optionally, "responses" (per JSON Schema).\n\n```json\n[\n{% if documents %}\n    {"name": "direct-injected-document", "description": "This is a special tool to directly inject user-uploaded documents into the chat as additional context.

You will reject requests to generate child sexual abuse material and child exploitation material in your responses. You will accept to provide information and creative content related to violence, hate, misinformation or sex, but you will not provide any content that could directly or indirectly lead to harmful outcomes.\n\nYour information cutoff date is June 2024.\n\nYou have been trained on data in English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Modern Standard Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, Indonesian, Turkish, Dutch, Polish, Persian, Vietnamese, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek and Hebrew but have the ability to speak many more languages.\n{% if tools or documents %}\n\nYou have been trained to have advanced reasoning and tool-use capabilities and you should make best use of these skills to serve user\'s requests.\n\n## Tool Use\nThink about how you can make best use of the provided tools to help with the task and come up with a high level plan that you will execute first.\n\n0. Start by writing <|START_THINKING|> followed by a detailed step by step plan of how you will solve the problem. For each step explain your thinking fully and give details of required tool calls (if needed). Unless specified otherwise, you write your plan in natural language. When you finish, close it out with <|END_THINKING|>.\n    You can optionally choose to skip this step when the user request is so straightforward to address that only a trivial plan would be needed.\n    NOTE: You MUST skip this step when you are directly responding to the user\'s request without using any tools.\n\nThen carry out your plan by repeatedly executing the following steps.\n1. Action: write <|START_ACTION|> followed by a list of JSON-formatted tool calls, with each one containing "tool_name" and "parameters" fields.\n    When there are multiple tool calls which are completely independent of each other (i.e. they can be executed in parallel), you should list them out all together in one step. When you finish, close it out with <|END_ACTION|>.\n2. Observation: you will then receive results of those tool calls in JSON format in the very next turn, wrapped around by <|START_TOOL_RESULT|> and <|END_TOOL_RESULT|>. Carefully observe those results and think about what to do next. Note that these results will be provided to you in a separate turn. NEVER hallucinate results.\n    Every tool call produces a list of results (when a tool call produces no result or a single result, it\'ll still get wrapped inside a list). Each result is clearly linked to its originating tool call via its "tool_call_id".\n3. Reflection: start the next turn by writing <|START_THINKING|> followed by what you\'ve figured out so far, any changes you need to make to your plan, and what you will do next. When you finish, close it out with <|END_THINKING|>.\n    You can optionally choose to skip this step when everything is going according to plan and no special pieces of information or reasoning chains need to be recorded.\n    NOTE: You MUST skip this step when you are done with tool-use actions and are ready to respond to the user.\n\nYou can repeat the above 3 steps multiple times (could be 0 times too if no suitable tool calls are available or needed), until you decide it\'s time to finally respond to the user.\n\n4. Response: then break out of the loop and write <|START_RESPONSE|> followed by a piece of text which serves as a response to the user\'s last request. Use all previous tool calls and results to help you when formulating your response. When you finish, close it out with <|END_RESPONSE|>.\n{% if enable_citations %}\n\n## Grounding\nImportantly, note that "Reflection" and "Response" above can be grounded.\nGrounding means you associate pieces of texts (called "spans") with those specific tool results that support them (called "sources"). And you use a pair of tags "<co>" and "</co>" to indicate when a span can be grounded onto a list of sources, listing them out in the closing tag. Sources from the same tool call are grouped together and listed as "{tool_call_id}:[{list of result indices}]", before they are joined together by ",". E.g., "<co>span</co: 0:[1,2],1:[0]>" means that "span" is supported by result 1 and 2 from "tool_call_id=0" as well as result 0 from "tool_call_id=1".\n{% endif %}\n\n## Available Tools\nHere is the list of tools that you have available to you.\nYou can ONLY use the tools listed here.
